# personal-website

All of the front end for my personal website can be found here.

All the styling and javascript is in the assets folder. Double click on the index.html to see the front end in action. 

Shout out to w3schools.com where I pretty much learned everything I needed to make this.

They have pre-made templates at: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp
